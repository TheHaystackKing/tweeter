# tweeter
This project was developed for a computer science course and consists of an Android mobile app with a back-end originally hosted on AWS. The app is designed to emulate Twitter, incorporating key features such as user following, posting, and a personalized feed displaying posts from followed users.

Please note that the AWS server is no longer active, so the app has been converted into a demo version. If you'd like to explore the app, you can run it in an emulator or build the APK and install it on a physical device. The app operates with dummy data, but there is no data persistence in this demo version.
